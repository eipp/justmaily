# Authentication Guide

Authentication is the first line of defense for your application.

## Key Concepts

- **Token-Based Authentication:**  
  Use JWTs or similar token mechanisms to authenticate users without maintaining session state.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  Consider adding MFA for sensitive operations.

- **Password Policies:**  
  Enforce strong password policies and secure password storage (hashing, salting).

## Implementation

- Use established libraries and frameworks for handling authentication.
- Regularly update authentication flows to handle emerging threats.
