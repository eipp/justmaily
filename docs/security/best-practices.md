# Security Best Practices

Maintain security discipline by following these best practices:

- **Use HTTPS:**  
  Always serve content over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

- **Secure Cookies:**  
  Set cookies as secure and HttpOnly to minimize XSS risks.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Do not hard-code sensitive credentials. Use secure secret management (e.g., environment files, cloud secrets).

- **Regular Audits:**  
  Run security audits regularly (e.g., using `npm audit`).

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Keep third-party packages up to date and review them for vulnerabilities.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  
  Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

- **Access Control:**  
  Implement robust authentication and authorization for APIs and services.
