# Data Architecture Overview

## 3.1 Data Architecture Overview
Maily’s data infrastructure prioritizes zero-party data sovereignty, real-time scalability, and privacy-by-design while enabling AI agents to act autonomously.

### 3.1.1 Core Components
| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Zero-Party Data Hub | Snowflake Cortex + Decodable (stream processing) | Collect & process user-provided data (quizzes, preferences) in real time. |
| Behavioral Data Lake | Apache Iceberg on AWS S3 + Delta Lake | Store interaction data (clicks, hovers) for AI agent training & personalization. |
| Compliance Engine | OneTrust + Immuta (GDPR/CCPA automation) | Auto-redact PII, enforce retention policies, and manage consent. |
| Real-Time Sync | Redpanda (Kafka replacement) + Materialize | Stream data to AI agents with sub-second latency for adaptive campaigns. |
| Decentralized Storage | IPFS (optional) + AWS S3 Glacier | Securely archive inactive campaigns; IPFS for audit trails (optional). |

## 3.2 Zero-Party Data Workflow
**Collection:**

* Users submit preferences via interactive email widgets (e.g., “Which topics interest you?”).
* Data is encrypted client-side using WebAssembly (Wasm)-compiled AES-256 before transmission.

**Processing:**

* Decodable streams clean, normalized data to Snowflake Cortex.
* AI agents use Zep to correlate preferences with behavioral data (e.g., “Users who prefer sustainability click eco-products 3x more”).

**Activation:**

* Real-time segments pushed to Fireworks.ai for model fine-tuning (e.g., DeepSeek R1 adapters for eco-conscious users).

## 3.3 Privacy & Compliance
### 3.3.1 Automated GDPR/CCPA Enforcement
**OneTrust Integration:**

* Consent receipts stored as NFTs on Polygon (tamper-proof audit trail).
* Auto-delete user data upon request via pre-built Snowflake workflows.

**PII Redaction:**

* Presidio (Microsoft) + Claude 3.5 Sonnet detect/redact sensitive fields (e.g., SSNs) in unstructured text.

### 3.3.2 Data Residency
**Multi-Region Deployment:**

* EU: AWS Frankfurt (GDPR) / US: Azure East (CCPA) / APAC: GCP Tokyo.
* Data pinned to regions via CockroachDB (geo-partitioning).

### 3.3.3 Quantum-Safe Security
**Encryption:**

* NIST CRYSTALS-Kyber for quantum-resistant TLS.
* Hashicorp Vault manages encryption keys with Shamir Secret Sharing.

## 3.4 Sustainability Features
**Carbon-Optimized Storage:**

* Snowflake Search Optimization Service reduces query energy use by 40% via AI-driven indexing.
* AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering auto-archives unused data to Glacier.

**Emissions Tracking:**

* Climatiq API calculates CO₂ per query/campaign, displayed in dashboards.

## 3.5 AI Agent Data Access
**Policy:** Least privilege via OpenPolicyAgent (OPA):

```rego
# Example OPA rule: Only Campaign Strategist agents can access revenue data  
default allow = false  
allow {  
  input.role == "campaign_strategist"  
  input.resource == "revenue_metrics"  
}
```
**Tool:** Agents request temporary credentials via AWS IAM Roles Anywhere.

## 3.6 Self-Healing Data Pipelines
**Anomaly Detection:**

* Monte Carlo monitors data quality (e.g., sudden drop in email opens).

**Auto-Remediation:**

* Agents trigger GPT-Engineer to rebuild broken pipelines (e.g., Shopify API schema change).

```python
# GPT-Engineer prompt for pipeline repair  
prompt = """  
Fix the broken Snowflake pipeline for Shopify order data:  
- Error: 'OrderID' field missing in new API version  
- Solution: Map 'order_id' to 'OrderID' with type coercion  
"""
```

### Technical Validation
* **Latency:** Redpanda streams data to agents in <50ms (p99).
* **Scale:** Snowflake handles 100TB+ of zero-party data with ACID compliance.
* **Compliance:** OneTrust auto-resolves 95% of GDPR deletion requests within 24hrs.
