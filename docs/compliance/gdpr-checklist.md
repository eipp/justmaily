# GDPR Compliance Checklist

This document outlines our automation strategy and checklist for ensuring GDPR compliance. Our approach leverages OneTrust to automate data privacy measures and includes the following key components:

- **OneTrust Integration:** Centralized management for data privacy and compliance.
- **Automated PII Redaction:** Implementation of automated detection and redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in user communications and logs.
- **Granular Consent Management:** Strict tracking and enforcement of user consent levels to ensure personalized privacy settings.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Alerts and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to privacy breaches.
- **Regular Audits:** Scheduled reviews and audits to verify ongoing compliance with GDPR regulations.
- **Documentation of Data Lifecycle:** Detailed recording of data flow, storage duration, and retention policies.

These measures work together to ensure that our platform not only meets but exceeds GDPR requirements.
