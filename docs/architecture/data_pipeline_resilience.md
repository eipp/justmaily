# Data Pipeline Resilience and Disaster Recovery

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made for data pipeline resilience on the JustMaily platform in Sprint 3. The changes include:

- Integration of Monte Carlo for data observability
- Implementation of an automated self-healing mechanism
- A comprehensive disaster recovery strategy using geographically redundant CockroachDB clusters

## Data Observability
The Monte Carlo configuration is provided in `data/observability/montecarlo-config.yaml`. Key aspects include:

- Monitoring the ETL process every 15 minutes
- Alerting for anomalies detected based on an adjustable threshold

## Automated Self-Healing
The self-healing automation script in `data/self-healing/self_healing.py` monitors the data pipelines and automatically triggers remedial actions. It uses a dummy GPT-Engineer inspired approach for error detection and remediation:

- Simulated error detection
- Remediation routines triggered when errors are detected

## Disaster Recovery Strategy
The disaster recovery framework includes:

- A Kubernetes manifest in `dr/cockroachdb-cluster.yaml` to deploy a geographically redundant CockroachDB cluster
- Immutable backup procedures with automated restore processes
- Detailed DR operational guidelines in `DR_STRATEGY.md`

## Operational Guidelines
- Continuous monitoring via Monte Carlo ensures real-time anomaly detection and alerting.
- Automated self-healing routines minimize downtime by addressing common pipeline issues.
- Regular DR drills, backup verifications, and restoration tests ensure data integrity and availability.

## Conclusion
These enhancements strengthen the resilience of our data pipelines and ensure robust disaster recovery, aligning with production-grade operational standards for the JustMaily platform.
