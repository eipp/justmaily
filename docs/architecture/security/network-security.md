# Network Security & Zero Trust Integration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to hardening network security by implementing a Zero Trust Architecture. Our strategy leverages Cloudflare Zero Trust for microsegmentation, integrates eBPF-based network monitoring tools (such as Cilium), and defines initial Kubernetes network policies for enhanced security and real-time threat detection.

## Cloudflare Zero Trust Integration
- **Objective:** Enforce identity-based access controls and microsegmentation within our system.
- **Approach:**
  - Integrate Cloudflare Zero Trust as a gateway for internal and external traffic.
  - Use Cloudflare Access to restrict access to critical services and applications.
  - Configure rules and policies to limit lateral movement within the network.

## eBPF and Network Monitoring
- **Objective:** Enhance real-time threat detection using eBPF-based tools.
- **Tools:** Evaluate and prototype Cilium or similar platforms for monitoring network flows and detecting anomalous behavior.
- **Approach:**
  - Deploy a sandbox environment with eBPF capabilities.
  - Implement monitoring rules and alerts for suspicious network activity.
  - Use insights to fine-tune network policies and response actions.

## Kubernetes Network Policies
- **Objective:** Establish baseline network configurations that support a zero trust model within our Kubernetes clusters.
- **Approach:**
  - Define and implement restrictive network policies for inter-pod communication.
  - Enable logging and monitoring for network policy breaches.
  - Test and iterate on configurations to ensure minimal disruption while maximizing security.

## Roadmap and Next Steps
1. **Phase 1:** Research and setup a development environment for Cloudflare Zero Trust and eBPF tools.
2. **Phase 2:** Develop and deploy proof-of-concept integrations, including initial network policies in Kubernetes.
3. **Phase 3:** Evaluate performance, security impact, and refine configurations based on monitoring data.
4. **Phase 4:** Document findings, update policies, and prepare for staged rollouts in production.

## Documentation and Testing
- Update existing CI/CD configurations to include security tests for network policies.
- Document detailed setup instructions and testing procedures in our TESTING.md and README files.

This strategy lays the foundation for a robust Zero Trust network and continuous monitoring, ensuring that our platform is resilient against emerging threats.
