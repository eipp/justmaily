# Security Enhancements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in Sprint 2 for the justmaily platform. The focus is on centralized secrets management, advanced encryption measures, and zero trust network hardening.

## Task 2.1: Centralized Secrets Management Deployment

### Vault Deployment Manifests
- **Development**: Refer to `security/vault/vault-deployment-dev.yaml`
  - Uses in-memory storage with Shamir secret sharing (5 recovery shares, threshold of 3).
- **Staging**: Refer to `security/vault/vault-deployment-staging.yaml`
  - Uses Raft storage at `/vault/data` with node_id `vault-staging` and Shamir secret sharing.
- **Production**: Refer to `security/vault/vault-deployment-prod.yaml`
  - Uses Raft storage with TLS enabled (certificates stored at `/vault/config`) and Shamir secret sharing.

#### Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy the Vault manifests using `kubectl apply -f <manifest_file>` for the respective environments.
2. Ensure that environment-specific secrets (tokens and certificates) are managed securely outside of these manifests.

## Task 2.2: Advanced Encryption Measures

### TLS Configuration Prototype
A prototype TLS configuration using advanced encryption measures is provided:
- File: `security/encryption/tls-config.yaml`
  - Demonstrates TLS 1.3 with a hybrid key exchange approach labeled as `hybrid-kyber` (representing CRYSTALS-Kyber integration).
  - Lists experimental cipher suites combining standard algorithms with Kyber enhancements.

### Encryption Upgrade Roadmap
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current encryption implementations across the platform.
2. **Prototype**: Integrate and test CRYSTALS-Kyber as part of the TLS handshake in non-production environments.
3. **Migration Plan**: Develop a phased migration plan ensuring backward compatibility.
4. **Upgrade**: Update TLS settings, API server configurations, and data storage components sequentially.
5. **Validation**: Conduct security audits and performance benchmarks.

## Task 2.3: Zero Trust Architecture & Network Hardening

### Cloudflare Zero Trust Integration
- File: `security/cloudflare/zero-trust-config.yaml`
  - Defines Zero Trust policies, tunnel settings, and ingress rules for internal service access.
  - Example policy allows specific identities (e.g., marketing team) while denying all others.

### eBPF-based Monitoring with Cilium
- File: `security/ebpf/cilium-deployment.yaml`
  - Deploys Cilium as a DaemonSet in the `kube-system` namespace for real-time threat detection and network monitoring.
  - Configured with eBPF monitoring enabled, exposing metrics on port 9090.

## Deployment & Operational Guidelines

- **Testing**: Validate all configurations in development and staging environments before production rollout.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate security audits into the existing CI/CD pipelines found in the `ci/` directory.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor logs and metrics from Vault, TLS endpoints, Cloudflare Zero Trust policies, and Cilium.
- **Access Control**: Regularly review and update access control policies in Vault and Cloudflare to ensure compliance with evolving requirements.
- **Documentation**: Keep this document updated with any changes to deployment procedures or operational practices.

## Conclusion
These enhancements aim to elevate the security posture of the justmaily platform by implementing centralized secrets management, next-generation encryption strategies, and robust network protection. Further testing and continuous monitoring are essential for maintaining a secure production environment.
