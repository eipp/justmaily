# Kubernetes Setup

Deploying Maily on Kubernetes can help with scalability and resilience.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (minikube for local testing or a cloud provider for production)
- kubectl configured for your cluster
- A container registry to store your Docker images

## Steps

1. **Build and Push the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-registry/myapp:latest .
   docker push your-registry/myapp:latest
   ```

2. **Create Kubernetes Deployment Files**

   Create a deployment YAML (see sample below):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: your-registry/myapp:latest
           ports:
             - containerPort: 3000
           env:
             - name: NODE_ENV
               value: "production"
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - port: 80
       targetPort: 3000
     selector:
       app: myapp
   ```

3. **Deploy to the Cluster**

   Apply your configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy.yml
   ```

4. **Monitor the Deployment**

   Use the following commands to monitor:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```
