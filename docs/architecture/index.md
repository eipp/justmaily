# Maily System Architecture

## Overview

Maily is an AI-first email marketing platform built with autonomous AI agents, integrated long-term memory, dynamic tool generation, and zero-trust security principles. This document outlines the high-level architecture and deployment considerations for a production-level system.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator & Specialized Agents
- **Orchestrator:** Decomposes user campaign goals into discrete tasks and assigns them to specialized agents.
- **Specialized Agents:**
  - **Campaign Strategist:** Generates creative campaign variants.
  - **Toolsmith:** Automatically builds missing integrations (e.g., Shopify API clients) via GPT-Engineer.
  - **Compliance Guard:** Enforces GDPR compliance and ethical guardrails including PII redaction.

### 2. Model Management
- **Primary Model:** DeepSeek R1 deployed on Azure AI with GPU-optimized nodes.
- **Fallback Models:** Configurable via a unified `config/models.yaml` enabling a switch to models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Llama 3.1.

### 3. Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration:** Deployments managed via Kubernetes with dedicated GPU nodes and node selectors.
- **Security:** Implements zero-trust networking, encrypted transit (TLS 1.3 with quantum-safe algorithms), and secure secrets management (e.g., Hashicorp Vault).

### 4. Data Infrastructure & Memory
- **Long-Term Memory Integration:** Uses a system like Zep to store contextual data including campaign history and user preferences.
- **Data Pipelines:** Ingestion of zero-party and behavioral data via modern data processing tools (Snowflake Cortex, Apache Iceberg/Delta Lake, Redpanda).

### 5. UI/UX and Front-End
- **Framework:** Built using Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance).
- **Adaptive Layout:** Three-panel interface comprising an AI Co-Pilot, a Campaign Studio, and an Analytics Hub.

## Monitoring, Testing & CI/CD
- **Testing:** High test coverage using unit/integration tests (Jest, PyTest) and E2E tests (Cypress).
- **CI/CD:** Automated pipelines via GitHub Actions and deployment orchestration with Argo CD.
- **Observability:** Monitoring via Datadog, Prometheus, and New Relic to ensure performance and system integrity.

## Future Extensions
- **Advanced UI:** AR previews, voice/gesture interaction, and dynamic dark mode.
- **Self-Healing & Auto-Debug:** Autonomous detection and correction of system issues.
- **Ethical Auditing:** Regular bias audits and automated compliance enforcement using tools like NeMo Guardrails.
