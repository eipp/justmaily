# Next-Generation Data Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a strategic architecture for building a next-generation data infrastructure. It prioritizes the immediate implementation of key components while planning for future scalability and feature expansion.

## Immediate Implementations

### Snowflake: Central Zero-Party Data Hub
- **Purpose:** Serve as the central repository for zero-party data, where users voluntarily provide their data.
- **Functionality:** Acts as the system of record, enabling secure storage, unified analytics, and data governance.

### Redpanda: Real-Time Data Streaming
- **Purpose:** Enable real-time data ingestion and event-driven processing.
- **Functionality:** Streams data with low-latency processing, bridging edge data and centralized storage in Snowflake.

## Future Scalability and Feature Expansion

### Data Lake Integration (Consider Apache Iceberg)
- **Purpose:** Manage large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data.
- **Plan:** Integrate a data lake solution like Apache Iceberg to support flexible schema evolution and efficient querying.

### Data Privacy and Consent Management (Consider OneTrust)
- **Purpose:** Embed comprehensive data privacy and consent management within the data infrastructure.
- **Plan:** Integrate a platform such as OneTrust to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, managing explicit user consent.

### Real-Time Materialized Views (Consider Materialize)
- **Purpose:** Facilitate dynamic, real-time analytics on streaming data.
- **Plan:** Utilize systems like Materialize to create materialized views over streaming data, making it accessible through SQL for rapid insights.

## Evaluating IPFS for Decentralized Data Storage

### Use Cases:
- **Resilient Data Storage:** Explore using IPFS for decentralized, censorship-resistant data storage to enhance system resilience.
- **Archival Solutions:** Consider IPFS for permanent archival of logs, audit trails, or other data that benefits from distributed replication.

### Considerations:
- **Scalability & Performance:** Assess IPFS for data retrieval speeds, latency, and cost-effectiveness compared to centralized storage.
- **Security & Compliance:** Address regulatory compliance and data security challenges associated with decentralized storage.

- Evaluation of IPFS for decentralized and resilient data storage

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture lays the foundation for a robust, next-generation data infrastructure. By leveraging Snowflake and Redpanda now, and planning integrations with Apache Iceberg, OneTrust, and Materialize, the system is designed to be modular, scalable, and resilient. Additionally, evaluating IPFS offers a pathway to incorporate decentralized data storage for specific use cases, ensuring long-term sustainability and adaptability.
