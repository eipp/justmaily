# Comprehensive Code Style and Formatting Standards

## Naming Conventions
- Variables & functions: Use camelCase.
- Classes & components: Use PascalCase.
- Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

## Indentation & Spacing
- Use 2 spaces per indent.
- Ensure consistent spacing around operators, keywords, and delimiters.

## Commenting Practices
- Use inline comments sparingly for non-obvious logic.
- Document functions, classes, and modules with JSDoc-style comments.
- Include file-level headers for modules with high-level overviews.

## Code Structure & Organization
- Order imports by standard libraries, third-party packages, then local modules.
- Keep modules and functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid deep nesting; refactor complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.

## Best Practices
- Favor immutability and pure functions.
- Use const and let appropriately.
- Implement robust error handling and logging suitable for production environments.
- Write tests alongside production code to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Documentation & Maintenance
- Update documentation in tandem with code changes.
- Adhere to these guidelines to maintain consistent, high-quality code across the project.
