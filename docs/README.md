# Deployment Instructions

This project uses a production-grade CI/CD pipeline along with containerization and automated deployment scripts.

## Automated Deployment

A deployment script is provided in `infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh`. It performs the following tasks:
  - Database backup using `pg_dump`
  - Running database migrations (e.g., via `npm run migrate`)
  - Building and deploying the Docker container using `docker-compose`

### How to Deploy

Run the following command to start deployment:

```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh deploy
```

For rollback, run:

```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh rollback
```

## Containerization & Orchestration

The application is containerized using a `Dockerfile` and orchestrated with Docker Compose. Key files include:
  - `Dockerfile`: Builds your production-ready image.
  - `docker-compose.yaml`: Defines service orchestration for the web app and its dependencies (e.g., Postgres).

## Environment Variables & Security

Ensure that sensitive environment variables (such as database credentials) are managed securely. Use environment files or secret management services as needed. Refer to `apps/maily-analyze/env-vars.js` as an example of how to separate configuration from code.

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

- **Build Failures:**  
  Ensure your Node.js version matches the version specified in the workflow and Dockerfile.

- **Deployment Failures:**  
  Check logs from the deployment script (`infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh`). Make sure environment variables such as `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_NAME` are set correctly.

- **Container Issues:**  
  View container logs using `docker-compose logs` for services like `web` or `db`.

# Architecture Overview

The application follows a microservice-inspired structure with the following components:
  - **Web Service:**  
    Runs on Node.js and handles requests. Containerized using Docker.
  - **Database:**  
    A PostgreSQL service coordinated via Docker Compose.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
    Uses GitHub Actions to automate testing, security audits, performance checks, and deployments.

# Operational Runbooks

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Database Backups:**  
  Automated daily backups are performed during deployment. Verify backups are stored securely.

- **System Health Checks:**  
  Periodically run load tests and performance audits to ensure system integrity.

## Performance Tuning & Incident Response

- **Performance Tuning:**  
  Monitor key metrics using integrated tools like Lighthouse CI, Artillery, and external monitoring services.

- **Incident Response:**  
  In case of performance degradation or service outages, consult the logs, initiate the rollback process if needed, and review recent deployment changes.
