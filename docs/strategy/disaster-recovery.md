# Disaster Recovery Plan for Maily

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the disaster recovery (DR) strategy for Maily, an Autonomous Email Marketing Platform. The objective is to ensure high availability, robust data protection, and rapid recovery during unexpected incidents.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure minimal data loss in the event of a failure.
- Maintain continuous service by leveraging geographically redundant CockroachDB clusters.
- Establish immutable backup and restoration procedures.
- Integrate observability and self-healing mechanisms into data pipelines.

## 3. Architecture Overview
### 3.1 Geographically Redundant CockroachDB Clusters
- Utilize multiple CockroachDB clusters across different geographic regions.
- Primary cluster for active operations, with secondary clusters acting as failover in a disaster.
- Configure network and replication for data consistency across clusters.

## 4. Backup Strategy
### 4.1 Immutable Backups
- Schedule periodic backups using CockroachDB's built-in backup tools.
- Store backups in an immutable, versioned storage system (e.g., S3 with versioning) to prevent tampering.
- Automate backup creation using CI/CD pipelines and scheduled tasks.

### 4.2 Testing Backup Procedures
- Regularly test restoration processes in a staging environment.
- Validate backup integrity through controlled restore operations.
- Document test procedures and outcomes for continuous improvement.

## 5. Disaster Recovery Procedures
### 5.1 Immediate Response
- Monitor for infrastructure failures or data pipeline anomalies via the observability tool (e.g., Monte Carlo in pilot mode).
- Automatically trigger failover procedures if significant anomalies or failures are detected.

### 5.2 Restoration Process
1. Identify the last valid immutable backup.
2. Initiate the restoration to a geographically designated failover CockroachDB cluster.
3. Validate data integrity post-restoration.
4. Redirect application endpoints to the restored cluster.
5. Confirm system stability and resume normal operations.

### 5.3 Fallback Mechanisms
- Implement automatic health checks and rollback routines.
- Maintain an on-call schedule for manual intervention if automated failover fails.
- Conduct periodic drills and simulations to validate readiness.

## 6. Integration with Observability and Self-Healing
### 6.1 Data Pipeline Observability
- Integrate an observability tool (e.g., Monte Carlo) in pilot mode to monitor ETL processes and data flows.
- Configure alerts and monitoring endpoints to detect pipeline disruptions early.

### 6.2 Self-Healing Mechanisms
- Develop remediation scripts using GPT-Engineer to auto-generate responses for common pipeline issues.
- Design a modular proof-of-concept (POC) including:
  - Error anomaly detection logic.
  - Automated triggers for remediation routines (e.g., restarting failed components).
- Ensure the design is flexible to incorporate additional heuristics or user-defined rules in the future.

## 7. Long-Term Roadmap
- Scale integration of observability and self-healing modules across all microservices.
- Conduct regular reviews and updates of the DR plan based on testing and real-world incidents.
- Integrate feedback loops to continuously enhance backup integrity and recovery speed.

## 8. Security and Compliance Considerations
- Integrate with existing secrets management systems (e.g., Vault) to secure backup and restoration credentials.
- Ensure encryption of data in transit and at rest during backup and recovery operations.
- Regularly audit DR procedures to meet industry security standards and compliance requirements.

## 9. Conclusion
This Disaster Recovery Plan provides a comprehensive framework to ensure data pipeline resilience and operational continuity for Maily. Ongoing testing, updates, and integration with observability and self-healing mechanisms are essential for adapting to evolving challenges.
