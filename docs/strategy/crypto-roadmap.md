# CRYSTALS-Kyber Integration Roadmap

## Overview
As part of our efforts to future-proof our encryption measures, this document outlines the integration strategy for NIST-standard CRYSTALS-Kyber, a leading post-quantum cryptographic scheme.

## Background
CRYSTALS-Kyber is a strong candidate for post-quantum public-key encryption. Its adoption is motivated by the emerging quantum threats and the need to align with evolving NIST standards.

## Proposed Implementation
- **TLS Integration:** Investigate how CRYSTALS-Kyber can augment or replace traditional key exchanges in TLS protocols.
- **Data Encryption:** Explore methods to utilize Kyber keys to secure data at rest and in transit.
- **Sandbox Proof-of-Concept:** Develop a prototype to manage CRYSTALS-Kyber key exchanges and encryption flows, ensuring compatibility with existing encryption components.

## Advantages
- Enhanced security against quantum computing threats.
- Future compliance with evolving NIST cryptographic standards.
- Flexibility for gradual integration into our existing infrastructure.

## Roadmap
1. Conduct initial research and experimental integration in a sandbox environment.
2. Evaluate performance, scalability, and compatibility impacts.
3. Iteratively test and refine the components as necessary.
4. Plan deployment stages with appropriate access controls and monitoring.

## Next Steps
- Develop a working prototype for key management using CRYSTALS-Kyber.
- Gather feedback and refine the implementation strategy.
- Regularly update encryption components based on new standards and research.
