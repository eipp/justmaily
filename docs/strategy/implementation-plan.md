# Implementation Plan for justmaily Production-Grade Workflow and Container Optimization

## 1. Workflow Orchestration Integration

### 1.1 Technology Selection
- Selected Temporal.io as our workflow engine for its proven production-grade features including automated retries, robust error handling, and comprehensive observability integration.

### 1.2 Code Integration
- Created Temporal workflows under the `/workflow` directory.
- Implemented the email workflow in `workflow/emailWorkflow.js` using the Temporal Node.js SDK.
- Configured activities with automatic retry policies and robust error handling.

### 1.3 Kubernetes Deployment
- Created a Kubernetes manifest in `k8s/temporal.yaml` to deploy Temporal with 3 replicas and a ClusterIP service exposing port 7233.

### 1.4 CI/CD Integration
- Updated CI pipelines to deploy Temporal along with the application using `kubectl apply -f k8s/temporal.yaml`.

## 2. Containerization & Autoscaling Optimization

### 2.1 Dockerfile Enhancements
- Updated `apps/maily-web/Dockerfile` to use a multi-stage build: a builder stage for asset compilation and a production stage with a minimal Node.js image.
- Achieved a smaller, more secure production image.

### 2.2 Kubernetes Manifests & Autoscaling
- Created an HPA manifest in `k8s/hpa-maily-web.yaml` for maily-web with appropriate resource limits and scaling thresholds.
- Validated readiness/liveness probes and resource requests in deployment manifests.

### 2.3 Logging & Monitoring
- Ensured all services, including Temporal, export detailed logs to our centralized logging system.
- Extended Prometheus monitoring to capture CPU usage, error rates, and request latencies.

## 3. Testing, Validation & Documentation

- Integration tests to simulate workflow execution and failure scenarios, validating retry and error handling behaviors.
- Validate autoscaling behavior under simulated loads.
- Update documentation and dashboards (e.g., Grafana) to reflect new system metrics and configurations.

## 4. Next Steps

- Deploy these configurations in staging.
- Monitor performance and adjust configurations as necessary.
- Finalize phased rollout to production post thorough testing.
- Integrate autonomous feedback from self-healing agents to iterate and optimize processes continuously.
