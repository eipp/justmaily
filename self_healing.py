Self-Healing Mechanism for Data Pipelines

This module demonstrates a simple self-healing mechanism for data pipelines.
It simulates health checks by randomly generating error counts and triggers remediation
actions when an anomaly is detected. Future enhancements include integrating GPT-Engineer
for auto-generating tailored remediation scripts and employing ML-based anomaly detection.
