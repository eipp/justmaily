# Maily Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture

Maily's infrastructure is designed to support an AI-first, autonomous, and self-improving email marketing platform. Our deployment architecture ensures self-hosted control, secure model deployment, and agile agent orchestration, all aligned with our strategic vision.

## Overview

Our infrastructure leverages Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, and Docker to enable:
- **Self-Hosted AI:** Deploy DeepSeek R1 models on Azure AI (AKS GPU clusters) with fine-tuning via LoRA adapters; fallback inference via Fireworks.ai.
- **Zero-Trust & Quantum-Safe Security:** Utilize TLS 1.3 with NIST CRYSTALS-Kyber, AES-256 encryption, and Hashicorp Vault for robust data protection.
- **Autonomous Agent Orchestration:** Integrate self-healing, autonomous AI agents that continuously optimize workflows and enforce ethical guardrails with NeMo Guardrails.
- **Multi-Cloud Resilience & Compliance:** Provision resources across Azure, AWS, and GCP while ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance and data sovereignty.

## Key Components

### Terraform Modules & Cloud Configurations
- **AKS Module:** Provisions Azure Kubernetes clusters dedicated to hosting DeepSeek R1 and autonomous AI agents.
- **Network Module:** Establishes zero-trust networking using advanced TLS (post-quantum) and strict firewall rules.
- **Redis & Storage Modules:** Provide scalable caching and secure storage, ensuring data residency and compliance.

### Kubernetes and Docker
- **Kubernetes:** Deploys Maily microservices along with self-healing autonomous AI agents using service meshes and environment overlays that enforce ethical guardrails.
- **Docker:** Builds consistent container images for each service, integrated with CI/CD pipelines for rapid, self-improving deployments.

## Security & Compliance

- **Zero-Trust Architecture:** All services communicate over TLS 1.3 with post-quantum encryption strategies. Identity and access are managed via state-of-the-art tools.
- **Compliance Automation:** GDPR/CCPA enforcement is automated through dedicated modules that protect user data and maintain data sovereignty.
- **Ethical AI:** Autonomous agents are guided by NeMo Guardrails to ensure operations remain ethical and transparent.

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
   - Navigate to the appropriate environment folder in `terraform/environments/`.
   - Initialize and apply Terraform configuration:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
     ```

2. **Service Deployment:**
   - Build container images using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build
     ```
   - Apply Kubernetes manifests:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev
     ```

3. **Self-Healing & Observability:**
   - Autonomous agents monitor deployments continuously and trigger automated remediation via integrated CI/CD pipelines.

## Alignment with Maily Vision

This infrastructure is a cornerstone of Maily's vision to deliver a self-hosted, AI-first, and autonomous email marketing platform. It supports fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 models, dynamic agent orchestration, and robust ethical and security protocols, ensuring that every layer of our technology stack contributes to a scalable, adaptive, and ethical marketing solution.
