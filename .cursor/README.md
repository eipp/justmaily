# JustMaily Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains project-specific Cursor AI rules that guide code generation to adhere to our strict project standards. These rules ensure modularity, maintainability, and performance across the monorepo. The directory includes the following files:

- **general.cursorrules:** Overall project-wide guidelines including configuration, dependency management, testing & CI/CD, security, and repository structure.
- **backend.cursorrules:** Rules and best practices for backend development, covering Next.js API endpoints and legacy Python modules.
- **frontend.cursorrules:** Guidelines for frontend development, focusing on React components, Next.js pages, and TailwindCSS styling.

Keep these rules updated as the project evolves.
